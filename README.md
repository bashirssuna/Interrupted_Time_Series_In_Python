Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis is a powerful quasi-experimental research design used to evaluate the impact of an intervention, policy, or treatment on a given outcome. 
It is particularly useful in situations where a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is not feasible or ethical. 
In this notebook, we will perform an ITS analysis on a dataset to evaluate the impact of an intervention on the outcome of interest. 
We will use Python and its libraries to perform the analysis and visualize the results.

For this study, we will use a dataset containing monthly proportions of urgent caesarean sections at a hospital before and after introduction of a Labour Care Guide. 
The Labour Care Guide (LCG) is a set of evidence-based practices aimed at improving the quality of care for pregnant women during labour and delivery. 
This replaced a Partograph, which was the standard. In this analysis we want to see the perfomance of the LCG in reducing the number of urgent caesarean sections.
